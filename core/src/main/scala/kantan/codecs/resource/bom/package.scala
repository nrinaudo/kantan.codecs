/** Adds Byte Order Mark support to resources.
  *
  * By importing this package, the default behaviour of kantan libraries will be changed to:
  *  * add a BOM when writing textual data (if one exists for the output charset).
  *  * attempt to find a BOM when reading textual data and, if one is found, use the corresponding charset (potentially
  *    overriding whatever charset was specified "in-code").
  *
  * Those behaviours are not enabled by default as they're very Microsoft-specific.
